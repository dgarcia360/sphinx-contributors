People who contribute to open-source projects could be spending their free time.
It does not matter if it is a code change, an epic, or fixing a small typo.
At the end of the day, this change makes the project better.
That's the reason why you should recognize every contribution!

Are you using **Sphinx** to document the open-source project?
Then **sphinxcontrib-ghcontributors** directive allows you to render all the usernames that have contributed to your repositories directly in your docs.

![example](https://github.com/dgarcia360/sphinxcontrib-ghcontributors/blob/master/docs/example.png)

## Installation

1. Install sphinxcontrib-ghcontributors using pip.

   ```bash
   pip install sphinxcontrib-ghcontributors
   ```

2. Add the extension to your Sphinx project ``conf.py`` file.

   ```python
   extensions = ['sphinxcontrib.ghcontributors']
   ```

## Usage

The extension defines the directive ``ghcontributors``. For each repository that you want to render its contributors, state the Github username and the repository name.

```rst
..  ghcontributors:: dgarcia360/sphinxcontrib-ghcontributors
```

## Parameters

- ``limit``: Number of contributors to list. Default is 10.

- ``order``: Results are sorted by number of contributions. This parameter controls whether they are sorted by most active users first (``DESC``) or least active users first (``ASC``). Default is ``DESC``.

- ``exclude``: Comma-separated list of usernames to exclude from the list. Default is empty.

- ``avatars``: Whether to include an image with the avatar returned by GitHub. Default is ``False``. Use CSS to customize the image size, since the returned images might vary.

- ``contributions``: Whether to show the total number of contributions by each user or not. Deafult is ``True``.

## Example

```rst
..  ghcontributors:: dgarcia360/sphinxcontrib-ghcontributors
    :limit: 20
    :order: ASC
    :exclude: dgarcia360,sphinx
```

This directive will render the least active 20 contributors, ordered in ascending order, excluding ``dgarcia360`` and ``sphinx`` usernames from the list.

## CSS Styling

The top element generated by this directive is an ``<ul>`` node with class ``ghcontributors``, so the list is highly customizable through CSS. For example:

```css
.ghcontributors img {
  width: 128px;
}
```
